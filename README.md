# Start with Ruby

## Introduction

Ruby is an open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

Here are some main features of Ruby :

- Ruby is open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license
- Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL
- Ruby is very much scalable
- Big programs written in Ruby are easily maintainable
- Ruby can be used for developing Internet and intranet applications
- Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

You'll find here some examples of using Ruby for my personnal use and test.

Hope it can help :)

## Test files

### Requirements and Makefile usage

Considering you already have Ruby on your host machine, you can use make to read any file inside this repo

```sh
make run FILE=[name of file]
```

### Simple tuto

`tuto.rb` is a simple ruby tutorial

### Ask a question

`ask-question.rb` use the method `gets` and `chomp`

When you enter your word, you'll see that your sentence is broken down into two lines and chomp can remove "\n" from the answer.

### Examples

Launch an example :

```sh
make run_example FILE=example_1
```

- example_1: convert the answer from string to number and test if the number is even, conditions
- example_2: Guess the number, comparison
- example_3: Is the word a palindrom ?
- example_4: array
- example_5: Hash and Hash class
- example_6: Symbols
- example_7: Loop, guess again the number WHILE loop
- example_8: Loop, guess again the number FOR loop, each for arrays and hash
- example_9: Loop, iterator LOOP BREAK

## Useful Resources

### Reserved Words

The following list shows the reserved words in Ruby.
These words may not be used as constant or variable names.

### Keywords and methods

Single line comment:

```rb
# This is a comment
```

Block comment

```rb
=begin
This is a comment
And another line
And another comment
=end
```

Create method

```rb
def method_name
    code
end

#with parameters
def method_name(params)
    code
end
```

Variables

```rb
varname = "Hello"
```

Conditions

```rb
&& # AND
|| # OR
! # reverse everything after
```

Conventions

```rb
method? # the ? gives a boolean
varname! # the ! indicate that value is modified
```

Convert

```rb
to_i # convert to integer
to_s # convert to string
```
