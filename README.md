# Start with Ruby

## Introduction

Ruby is an open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity.

Here are some main features of Ruby :

- Ruby is open-source and is freely available on the Web, but it is subject to a license
- Ruby is a server-side scripting language similar to Python and PERL
- Ruby is very much scalable
- Big programs written in Ruby are easily maintainable
- Ruby can be used for developing Internet and intranet applications
- Ruby can be embedded into Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)

You'll find here some examples of using Ruby for my personnal use and test.

Hope it can help :)
